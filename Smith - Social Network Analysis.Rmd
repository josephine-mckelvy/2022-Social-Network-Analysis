# Introduction to Network Analysis in R #
#########################################
#NETWORK: a set of interactions (edges) between objects (vertices)
#EDGES: ties, relations, associations, links, connections, flows, etc. from sender to receiver
#VERTICES: nodes, actors, organizations

#Kinds of Research Questions:
#how might context, behavioral rules, etc. impact ties (as a property of pairs), group structure (hierarchy, positions, roles), homophily ("birds of a feather stick together"), etc. to predict outcomes, behavior, etc.?

#Data Collection:
#surveys: nominate X friends
#interviews: who do you interact with under X conditions?

#Data Structures:
#ADJACENCY MATRIX: a square matrix where the rows and columns are all possible VERTICES (i.e., nodes, actors, organizations), and each cell's value represents the absence (=0) or presence (=1) of a relationship between the two intersecting nodes; i.e., if a pair of nodes are ADJACENT to one another

#EDGE LIST: set of rows denoting EDGES (i.e., ties, relations, links, connections, flows) from sender to receiver that ignores the absence (=0) of a tie; so isolates who do not send out or receive in a tie are left out of the graph 
#the first column is the sender of the tie
#the second column is the receiver of that tie

#NOMINATION LIST: set of rows including the sender, plus one receiver per column
#each row is the observation collected from a respondent's nominations or list of people they [insert verb] with

#Types of Ties:
#UNDIRECTED relationships that are bidirectional or reciprocal
#DIRECTED relationships where DIRECTions matter, because they may not be reciprocal
#Binary (if a tie exists at all) vs Valued (with varying strength/weakness) vs signed (with positive or negative sentiment)
```
#Plot from Adjacency Matrix:
```{r}
#1a. create a dataframe object called adj_matrix.df and read in your dataset:
adj_matrix.df <- read.csv("adjacency_matrix.csv")
#adjacency matrix: a square matrix where the rows and columns are all possible VERTICES (i.e., nodes, actors, objects), and each cell's value represents the absence (=0) or presence (=1) of a tie between the two intersecting nodes; i.e., if a pair of nodes are ADJACENT to one another 

#1a. turn that *.csv into a matrix:
adj_matrix.df <- as.matrix(adj_matrix.df) 
#add rownames to the matrix that mirror the column names:
rownames(adj_matrix.df)=colnames(adj_matrix.df)

#2. create a dataframe object called attributes.df and read in your attributes table storing the sex, grade, and race of each node (or student) in the network:
attributes.df <- read.csv("attributes.csv")
#the first column is the ID of each node, has to be in the same order as the adjacency matrix, and has to match the IDs in the edgelist

#3. create a network object called network_matrix using the graph_from_adjacency_matrix function (in the igraph library), with adj_matrix.df as the adjmatrix: 
#install.packages("igraph")
library(igraph) 
#?graph_from_adjacency_matrix
network_matrix <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adj_matrix.df,
                                           mode = "directed")

#DIRECTED: the DIRECTion of the tie matters because it may not be reciprocal
#UNDIRECTED: single, bidirectional ties with no loops

#4. map each of the attributes onto the network_matrix object using the set_vertex_attr function, with network_matrix as the graph, and the column of the attributes.df as the value; repeat for each column or attribute:  
#?set_vertex_attr
network_matrix <- set_vertex_attr(network_matrix,"sex", value = attributes.df$sex)
network_matrix <- set_vertex_attr(network_matrix,"grade", value = attributes.df$grade)
network_matrix <- set_vertex_attr(network_matrix,"race", value = attributes.df$race)
#the names of the attributes do not have to match the variable names in the attributes dataframe

#5 Plot
?plot.igraph
?igraph.plotting

#color nodes by grade
V(network_matrix)$color=vertex_attr(graph=network_matrix,"grade")
#color nodes by sex
color_gender=ifelse(attributes.df$sex=="Female","pink","blue") 
V(network_matrix)$color=color_gender 

plot(network_matrix, rescale=TRUE)

#more options
plot(network_matrix, 
#    layout = layout_in_circle,              #can remove for default plot
     vertex.color = color_gender,            #color nodes with ifelse statement based on attribute
     vertex.label = NA,                      #remove node ID labels
     vertex.size = colSums(adj_matrix.df),   #resize nodes, based on number of ties received in adjacency matrix
     vertex.frame.color = NA,                #remove black border of nodes
     edge.arrow.size = .5,                   #resize arrows along ties
     edge.arrow.width = .5,
     edge.color = "light gray",              #color ties
     edge.curved = .3)                       #curve the ties
```
#Plot from Edgelist:
```{r}
###########################################################################################
#1b. optional: create a dataframe object called edgelist.df and read in your dataset:
edgelist.df <- read.csv("edgelist.csv")
#edgelist: rows denoting EDGES (i.e., ties, relations, links, connections) from sender to receiver that ignores the absence (=0) of a tie 
#the first column is the sender of the tie
#the second column is the receiver of that tie
#the edgelist is good for large networks but will NOT show if there are isolates that did not receive in nor send out any ties 

#2. create a dataframe object called attributes.df and read in your attributes table storing the sex, grade, and race of each node (or student) in the network:
attributes.df <- read.csv("attributes.csv")
#the first column is the ID of each node, has to be in the same order as the adjacency matrix, and has to match the IDs in the edgelist

#3. create a network object called network_edgelist using graph_from_data_frame function (in the igraph library), with edgelist.df as the dataframe, directed is true, with the vertices (or nodes) option, that maps the attributes dataset onto the vertices:
#install.packages("igraph")
library(igraph)

#network_edgelist <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edgelist.df, 
#                                          directed = TRUE, 
#                                          vertices = attributes.df)

#DIRECTED: the DIRECTion of the tie matters because it may not be reciprocal
#UNDIRECTED: single, bidirectional ties with no loops
#igraph will add every variable in the attributes dataframe (except the first column, which is assumed to be the IDs of the nodes) to the created network object. 

#include a dataframe containing a simple ID variable for each node in the network (i.e., from 1 to 24) to include isolates without ties
network_edgelist <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edgelist.df,
                                          directed = TRUE,
                                          vertices = data.frame(id=1:24))
#4 PLOT
plot(network_edgelist, 
    #layout = layout_in_circle,              #can remove for default plot
     vertex.color = color_gender,            #color nodes with ifelse statement based on attribute
     vertex.label = NA,                      #remove node ID labels
     vertex.size = colSums(adj_matrix.df),   #resize nodes, based on number of ties received in adjacency matrix
     vertex.frame.color = NA,                #remove black border of nodes
     edge.arrow.size = .5,                   #resize arrows along ties
     edge.arrow.width = .5,
     edge.color = "light gray",              #color ties
     edge.curved = .3)                       #curve the ties
```
#Measures:
```{r}
#1. DEGREE: the number of edges for each actor;  
#outdegree: as the number of edges sent from actor i; or sum over the rows of the adj matrix.
#indegree: the number of edges received by actor i; or sum over the columns of the adj matrix.

outdeg=rowSums(adj_matrix.df) 
outdeg #We see that the first actor nominated 4 friends, the second actor nominated 2 friends, and so on. 

indeg=colSums(adj_matrix.df)
indeg #We see that the first actor received 1 nomination, the second actor received no nominations, and so on.

#OR use the degree function:
outdeg_igraph <- degree(graph=network_matrix, mode="out")
indeg_igraph <- degree(graph=network_matrix, mode="in")

outdeg==outdeg_igraph #the values of the outdeg object matches the output of the outdeg_igraph

#2. DENSITY: the total number of ties in the network, divided by the total number of ties possible.

#create an object, num_edges, using the function gsize that captures the number of ties in a dataset:
num_edges <- gsize(network_matrix) 
num_edges                                  #77 actual ties

#create an object, num_vertices, using the function gorder that captures the number of nodes in a dataset
num_vertices <- gorder(network_matrix) 
num_vertices                               #24 nodes

#create an object, num_dyads (excluding ii pairs), which tells us how many ties are possible in the network, 
#by using the factorial operation, n*(n-1),to count the possible distinct sequences or permutations of paths:
num_dyads <- num_vertices*(num_vertices-1) #24*23 = 552 possible ties

#create an object, density, which is the ratio of actual ties out of the number of possible ties.
density <- num_edges/num_dyads             #77 actual ties/552 possible ties = 0.1394928
density                                   

#OR use the edge_density function in igraph: 
edge_density(network_matrix)               #0.1394928

#3. WALK: a sequence of nodes and edges (backwards and forwards) that connect i to j, of a given length between i and j; or matrix multiplication. By raising the matrix to the nth power, we get the number of walks of length n between all ij pairs.

#create an object, walks2, that raises the matrix to the power of 2 to get the number of walks of length 2:
walks2=adj_matrix.df%*%adj_matrix.df
walks2 
#This suggests, for example, that there is one walk of length 2 between actor 1 and actor 1 (themself). 
#In this case, the walk is : 1->7->1. We can see this by looking at the rows for actor 1 and actor 7:
adj_matrix.df[c(1,7), ] 
#We can see that actor 1 is friends with 3, 5, 7 and 21. 
#We can also see that actor 7 is friends with 1, 9, 10 and 16, thus creating a walk of length 2: 1->7->1. 

#We can calculate the number of walks of length 3, 4, etc. in an analogous fashion. For example, for walks of length 3:
walks3=adj_matrix.df%*%adj_matrix.df%*%adj_matrix.df
walks3 
#Here, we see that there are 0 walks of length 3 from 1 to 1, but 4 different walks from 1 to 3 
#(for example, 1->3->8->3). 

#4. PATH: a sequence of nodes and edges, starting with one node and ending with another, with no repeats/retracing steps
#5. DISTANCE: the shortest path between nodes in a network. 

#create a matrix object, dist_mat, that holds the lenghts of the shortest path between all pairs of nodes:
dist_mat=distances(graph=network_matrix, mode="out")
dist_mat 
#Note that Inf (or infinity) means that i can not reach j through any path.

#OR use the all_shortest_paths function from actor 1 to actor 6:
all_shortest_paths(network_matrix, from=1, to=6) 

#compute the mean distance across all pairs in the distance matrix, computed above. 
#first, replace the diagonals, or distance to oneself (which is by definition, zero), with NA (or not-applicable):
diag(dist_mat)=NA
#also, exclude unreachable pairs, which will make the mean Inf:
mean(dist_mat[dist_mat!=Inf], na.rm=T) 
#Ignoring the unreachable pairs and diagonals, we see a mean value of 2.81.
#On average, actors are separated by paths of length 2.81. 

#6. CLOSENESS: the inverse of the distance matrix where there are unreachable pairs. 
#By inverting the distance matrix, all Infinity values are turned into zeroes and thus can be included in the mean calculation.
#The values range from 0 (not reachable, so minimum closeness) to 1 (directly connected, so maximum closeness).

#create an object, close_mat, that takes the inverse of the distance matrix object:
close_mat=1/dist_mat 
close_mat 

mean(close_mat, na.rm=T) #Here we calculate the mean closeness across all pairs, excluding the NAs on the diagonal. 
#Ignoring the NAs on the diagonal, we see a mean value of .348. 
#On average, actors are 1/2.87 paths close to each other. 

#It may also be useful to compute the median for comparison, if there are any outliers skewing the mean: 
median(dist_mat, na.rm=T)  #for distance
median(close_mat, na.rm=T) #for closeness
#In this case, the median yields the same information for mean distance and mean closeness, 
#that the median distance is 3 and the median closeness is 1/3. 

#7. REACHABILITY: whether actor i can reach actor j through any path. Actor i can reach actor j if the distance between i and j is less than Infinity (i.e., there is some path between i and j). 

#create an object, reach_mat, using an ifelse function to set the reachability matrix to:
#1 if distance is less than Inf 
#0 if distance is not less than Inf
reach_mat=ifelse(dist_mat <Inf, yes=1, no=0) 
reach_mat #We can see that actor 1 cannot reach actor 2 (for example).

#8. DIAMETER: the longest distance between any two nodes in the network. 

#create an object, diameter, that computes the maximum distance in the distance matrix, 
#excluding unreachable paths and NAs on the diagonal:
diameter <- max(dist_mat[dist_mat!=Inf], na.rm=T) 

#OR use the diameter function in igraph:
diameter(network_matrix)
